Python is a most powerfull programming language used to the data Visualization, Data Analysis, Scientific Computing and also in other very crucial fields or domains of digital world . The developer or programmer used it to the scratch because of it wide range in most of all sector and also with the help of tools and libraries like I mentioned below:
Python + Django = Web Development

Python + Matplotlib = Data Visualization

Python + Flask = Web Application

Python + Pygame = Game Development

Python + PyQt = Desktop Application

Python + TenserFlow = Machine Learning

Python + FastAPI = API Development

Python + Kivy = Mobile Devlopment

Python + Pandas = Data Analysis

Python + NumPy = Scientific Computing


And many more libraries are used to resolve the day to day life problem(on raw data(real time data)) with the help of Python and ML we trsined the model which help to reduce the workload of paper writting or logical algorithm dodge on real time data. So that , it is used to  Scientific Computing to the system or a Software in any domain Now a Days.
